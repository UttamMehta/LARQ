# Roles and Responsibility
As we are four member of team we have given every individual to work on different pages we did something different here as this is our second project like every individual work on that part which he did not done in his/her first project.
All member are flexible enough that what ever role given to them the are ready to take.
We have meeting at evening because that is the common time for us to talk about the progress.
We have ask our team member to give there id in such a way that it should not affect when we merge the other html pages(id like container_u as u belong to uttam same with other team member as well).
# Challenges Faced
While using import and export function for navbar it is very difficult to connect other pages with index page so at last we have to take that navbar to every pages and appended it.
This time the major challenge is to bring everyone on the same table means on same point to work in the project because some are worried of masai evaluation ,some are having personal issue.
After assign the task i find that every one did there work thinking like it is an assignment not like we will understand something new and i cannot find that energy ,enthusiasm in the team which affect everybody in the team.

# Conclusion
While working on this project i understand one think even if you know everything you can’t do everything single handedly.Leading this team was quite challenging and i loved the way project has completed.As a team we work on more functionality rather than Html and Css.

After cloning the LiveLarq.com website i found one thing that what i did in that week with this team can’t be possible to do if you can’t lead the team from the front.Lastly thanks to all the developer who worked to complete this project.
